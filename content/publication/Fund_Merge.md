abstract = "Consolidation among asset managers surged recently. What triggered this new wave of consolidation? Through a noisy rational expectation model with imperfect competition, we show that the rise of passive funds could attribute to the new change. As the size of passive funds grows, the market becomes more liquid. As a result, the rents extracted from noise traders shrinks and the competition among active funds becomes severer. These effects squeeze down the expected profit margins of active funds, hence stimulating them to form a coalition to gain monopolistic trading power. The rise of passive funds affects market outcomes (liquidity, price informativeness and volatility) both directly and indirectly through fund consolidation. The aforementioned two mechanisms have competing effects. Hence it is essential to control for fund consolidation when examining the (casual) relationship between passive funds and market outcomes."
