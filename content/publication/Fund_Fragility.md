abstract = "We examine the effects of monetary policy on the fragility of U.S. corporate bond mutual funds. The fund fragility originates from liquidation discount, which arises when investors redeem from funds. Through a global game model of investors runs, we show that the fund fragility can be exacerbated when Federal Reserve adopts an expansionary monetary policy. This is because monetary policy affects investors’ ex-ante asset allocation decisions. Moreover, in a liquid (an illiquid) market, the fund becomes more (less) fragile as monetary policy uncertainty increases. Using outflow-to-poor- performance sensitivity as a measure of the fund fragility, we empirically show that open-end mutual funds indeed become more fragile in an expansionary monetary policy regime, despite better funds’ performance."
