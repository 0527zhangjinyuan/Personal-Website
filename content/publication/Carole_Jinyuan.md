abstract = "Nelsen et al. [20] find bounds for bivariate distribution functions when there are constraints on the values of its quartiles. Tankov [25] generalizes this work by giving explicit expressions for the best upper and lower bounds for a bivariate copula when its values on a compact subset of [0; 1]2 are known. He shows that they are quasi-copulas and not necessarily copulas. Tankov [25] and Bernard et al. [3] both give sufficient conditions for these bounds to be copulas. In this note we give weaker sufficient conditions to ensure that both bounds are simultaneously copulas. Furthermore, we develop a novel application to quantitative risk management by computing bounds on a bivariate risk measure. This can be useful in optimal portfolio selection, in reinsurance, in pricing bivariate derivatives or in determining capital requirements when only partial information on dependence is available."
