abstract = "This study develops a BLP-type discrete choice model to study the air travel demand and airline competition in China. The developed method explicitly considers the potential effects of legacy regulations on airlinesâ€™ competition behavior in the domestic market. It is found that airlines set prices conclusively on the dense routes with strict market regulation and severe airport congestion. Airlines however compete more aggressively on less traveled routes with relatively light regulation. The model incorporating possible regulation effects is found to produce better estimation and predication results compared with specifications simply assuming Bertrand or Cournot airline competition. Demand estimates indicate that air travelers in China exhibit very similar preferences to those in developed and deregulated markets in terms of price elasticity, valuation of flight frequency and degree of aversion to airport congestion. Such findings are likely due to the fact that air travel in China has been mainly consumed by business and high-income groups, and the low cost carrier sector is yet to achieve its full potential."
